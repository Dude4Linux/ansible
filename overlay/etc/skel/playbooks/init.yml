# playbooks/init.yml
#
# This playbook prepares a host to be managed by ansible using the root
# account. You should run it just after new server has been installed and
# connected to the network. Make sure that you can access the root account
# through ssh. You might have to provide a password (in that case use '-k'
# switch on the command line to prompt for the password).
#
# Usage:
# ansible-playbook -k playbooks/init.yml -l "<hostname>"
#
